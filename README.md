Bridgeworld treasure break rates for crafting were inadvertently increased between the periods:

As the break rates were significantly higher than advertised (e.g. ~7.5% vs 18% for Tier 5), we will be looking to compensate all treasures broken during this period.

This repo details the list of crafters and the treasures that were broken during the affected period.

The total number of treasures that were broken are listed in `total_breaks.json`

The list of affected users and compensated treasures are listed in `compensate_addrs.json`
